## HW_3

Create a bash for loop that extracts only the element name from each of the _.xml_ files contained in _data-shell/data/elements_ directory.  The product of the loop should be a file called _el-names.txt_  containing the element names.

```
for filename in *.xml
do head -n 1 $filename | cut -d '"' -f 2 >> el-names.txt
done
```
